Hello,

This note is to express my interest in your posting for a Software Engineer role. I'm a 2019 graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Information Technology, and in my current role, I have hands-on experience using the .Net framework to create and enhance software applications.

Aside from my work I take a keen interest in learning Python and Django Framework. I have worked on some beginner to intermediate level projects and have been continuously learning to enhance my skills further.

I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your organization.

Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills. A few I would like to highlight that would enable me to contribute to your bottom line are:

    
    Thorough understanding of data structures and algorithms
    Knowledgeable of back-end development practices
    Hands-on software troubleshooting experience
    Strong Object Oriented Programming Knowledge.


Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.
