/*Swap Kth node from beginning with Kth node from end in a Linked List - GeeksforGeeks Java Solution*/

/*
However there are some corner cases, which must be handled

    Y is next to X
    X is next to Y
    X and Y are same
    X and Y donâ€™t exist (k is more than number of nodes in linked list)
